  # Informatin About Libraries
    Numpy :- 
      Numeric python package provides basic rutetion for manupulating large arrys and metrisis of numeric data
    Matplotlib:- 
      It is a visualisation library in python for 2-d plot of arrays. It is built upon numpy arrays. 
      It allows visual access to huge amt of data in easyly digestable visuals
      It consist of several plots :
            1 Line plot
            2 Histogram
