  # Information About Libraries
    Numpy :- 
      Numeric python package provides basic rutetion for manupulating large arrys and metrisis of numeric data
    
    Matplotlib:- 
      It is a visualisation library in python for 2-d plot of arrays. It is built upon numpy arrays. 
      It allows visual access to huge amt of data in easyly digestable visuals
      It consist of several plots :
            1 Line plot
            2 Histogram
            3 Pichart
            etc...
    
    Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn):- 
      Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various                         
      classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting,
      k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. 
      
# Key Terms:-
    Model:- 
      A machine learning model can be a mathematical representation of a real-world process. To generate a machine learning 
      model you will need to provide training data to a machine learning algorithm to learn from.
      
    Algorithm:- 
      Machine Learning algorithm is the hypothesis set that is taken at the beginning before the training starts with real-world 
      data. When we say Linear Regression algorithm, it means a set of functions that define similar characteristics as defined 
      by Linear Regression and from those set of functions we will choose one function that fits the most by the training data.
    
    Training:- 
      While training for machine learning, you pass an algorithm with training data. The learning algorithm finds patterns in 
      the training data such that the input parameters correspond to the target. The output of the training process is a machine 
      learning model which you can then use to make predictions. This process is also called “learning”.
    
    Regression:- 
      Regression techniques are used when the output is real-valued based on continuous variables. For example, any time series 
      data. This technique involves fitting a line.
    
    Classification:- 
      In classification, you will need to categorize data into predefined classes. For example, an email can either be ‘spam’ or 
      ‘not spam’.
    
    Target:- 
      The target is whatever the output of the input variables. It could be the individual classes that the input variables 
      maybe mapped to in case of a classification problem or the output value range in a regression problem. If the training set 
      is considered then the target is the training output values that will be considered.
    
    Feature:- 
      Features are individual independent variables that act as the input in your system. Prediction models use features to make 
      predictions. New features can also be obtained from old features using a method known as ‘feature engineering’. More 
      simply, you can consider one column of your data set to be one feature. Sometimes these are also called attributes. And 
      the number of features are called dimensions.
    
    Label:- 
      Labels are the final output. You can also consider the output classes to be the labels. When data scientists speak of 
      labeled data, they mean groups of samples that have been tagged to one or more labels.
